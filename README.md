# NFT Minting (ERC-721)

A simple ERC-721 NFT minting demo using Hardhat, Solidity, Ethers.js, and a basic HTML/JS web interface. Deploy and test NFT minting locally with MetaMask and a local blockchain. Great for learning and experimenting with NFT smart contracts and dApp integration.

## 1. Install & Start Local Blockchain

```bash
npm install
npx hardhat compile
npx hardhat node
```

## 2. Deploy the Smart Contract to Localhost
Open a new terminal:
```bash
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network localhost
```
Copy the contract address printed in the terminal (e.g., `0x...`).

## 3. Import Owner Account into MetaMask
- When running `npx hardhat node`, the terminal will show a list of accounts and private keys.
- Copy the private key of the first account and import it into MetaMask.
- Switch MetaMask to the ‚ÄúLocalhost 8545‚Äù network.

## 4. Edit `index.html`
- Replace the `CONTRACT_ADDRESS` variable with your deployed contract address.

## 5. Run a Local Web Server and Open the Demo
```bash
npx serve .
```
- Visit `http://localhost:3000/index.html` (or the corresponding port).
- Connect MetaMask, mint, and view your NFT.

## 6. Notes
- **Never** push your `.env` file or private keys to GitHub.
- Contract address and owner wallet address must be different.
- Only the owner (deployer account) can mint NFT (unless you modify the smart contract).
